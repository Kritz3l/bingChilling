============
NOTE: Version: 1.0.0. This Project is relatively new and (lets be hones here for a sec) might never be finished. There is no frontend to be viewed just now.

What this is all about: semester project for the module COMPP. The Idea is to have a Website where you can type in keywords and the app will create a playlist for you in your spotify account according to your keywords. Originally we intendet to implement an AI that chooses the songs for you but we'll have to do that later on. We'll just "fake" the AI-Part for now...

To run this project follow these steps:

install all pendencies: ```npm install``` (make sure you have node and npm installed!)

run the project: ```npm start```

and last but not least, visit: [a link](localhost:8888/api/login)
