What this is all about: semester project for the module COMPP. The Idea is to have a Website where you can type in keywords and the app will create a playlist for you in your spotify account according to your keywords. Originally we intendet to implement an AI that chooses the songs for you but we'll have to do that later on. We'll just "fake" the AI-Part for now...

To run this project follow these steps:

1. You will have to create your own app in spotify and add your credentials locally. So get that done first [first](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started). 
2. When you have your access tokens, copy the ``.env.template`` file, rename it to ``.env`` and replace the values with your access tokens. 
3. Install all pendencies: ```npm install``` (make sure you have node and npm installed!)
4. Run this bad boy with: ```npm start```

Aaaaand last but not least, visit: [localhost:8888/api/login](localhost:8888/api/login)

### NOTE:
Version: 1.0.0. This Project is relatively new and (lets be hones here for a sec) might never be finished. There is no frontend to be viewed just now.
